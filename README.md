Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyze how other campaign’s fundraising goals fared in comparison to Louise’s play that experienced success in a short amount of time. 

Analysis
Using factors such as launch date, country of origin, deadline, goal, percentage funded, outcomes, etc. I was able to compare and analyze the data sets using functions such as =ROUND() 
to determine the percentage of failed fundraisers vs the successful ones. I also used The =COUNTIFS() formula to further breakdown the “outcomes” column of the kickstarter worksheet into 
digestible numbers to create the “outcome vs goals” graph 

Challenges
Fortunately, I ran into only a few challenges based on formula syntax and improper usage that proved easy to fix. I accredit this to the fact that the modules on excel were clear 
and easy to understand

Results 
1.	According to the graph labeled “Theater Outcomes based on launch date”, it is clear that the best time to launch a campaign was in the month of June and the worst month to 
    launch was December.  
2.	The findings suggest that much like her fundraiser, many of the compared campaigns experienced overall success. This is made clear by the visual graph labeled “outcome vs goals”. 
3.	 Some limitations are the lack equal number of data from each year, lack of equal number of data from each country.
4.	Other possible tables/graphs could include: Passive vs Active voice in the fundraiser blurb category on outcome; location on outcome.
